# Connection-Aware Subscriptions Tracker

## Phase 4, Step 1: Create Subscription Utility Module

**Created**: `lib/foundation_web/live/subscriptions.ex`

This is a custom convention that provides safe subscription handling for LiveViews.

## Phase 4, Step 2: Test the Subscription Module

**Test File Created**: `test/foundation_web/live/subscriptions_test.exs`

## Phase 4, Step 3: Update LiveViews to Use Safe Subscriptions

### Search Results:
```bash
grep -r "Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe" lib/foundation_web/live/
```

**No direct Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe calls found in LiveViews!**

### LiveViews Analyzed:
1. **TaskDashboardLive** - Already has `connected?(socket)` check ✅
2. **TesterDemoLive** - **FIXED**: Added `connected?(socket)` check
3. **NewestTryLive** - No subscriptions (static data only) ✅

### Changes Made:
- **TesterDemoLive** (line 26): Changed from:
  ```elixir
  if data_source == :ash do
  ```
  To:
  ```elixir
  if connected?(socket) && data_source == :ash do
  ```

## Phase 4, Step 4: Test Each Updated LiveView

**Testing Requirements**:
1. Server is running (PID 97507)
2. TesterDemoLive should load without subscription errors
3. Real-time updates should still work when connected

**Testing Status**: Ready for manual testing at `/tester-demo` route

## Phase 4, Step 5: Document the Convention

## Connection-Aware Subscriptions

**What Changed**:
- Created FoundationWeb.Live.Subscriptions module
- Updated TesterDemoLive to use connection check before subscribing
- Note: No LiveViews actually use the Subscriptions module directly - they use WidgetData

**Why This Is Different from Standard Phoenix**:
- Standard Phoenix allows subscribing during disconnected mount
- This can cause errors that clutter logs
- Our approach prevents these errors by checking connected?(socket)

**When to Use**:
- ALWAYS check connected?(socket) before subscribing in LiveView mount
- For direct PubSub usage, use Subscriptions.safe_subscribe()
- Regular Elixir processes can still use direct subscriptions

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test that pages load without subscription errors
- Verify real-time updates still work
- Check logs for clean subscription messages
